# Python Scripts

The project contains two scripts for the two tasks.

Run the following command to prepare and activate the virtual environment
before running the script.
```
make venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Run `./get_open_interest.py` for the first task.

Run `./ext_stats.py ` for the second task. You can use
`-r` to explore subdirectories recursively.
